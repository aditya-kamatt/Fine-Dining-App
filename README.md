# Fine Dining App

This project aims to streamline the ordering process in restaurants by providing a digital system for managing orders and table service. It replaces traditional paper-based order systems with a modern solution that uses EasyKDS for kitchen display and EasyRestro for order management.

## Features
- Manage multiple restaurants from one app.
- Customizable restaurant menus (categories and items).
- Track ongoing orders and table assignments.
- Waiter-friendly order-taking system with preview before sending to the kitchen.
- Efficient and paperless communication between kitchen and waitstaff.

## Technology
- **Languages**: Java, XML
- **Tools**: Firebase Realtime Database, Android Studio

## How It Works
- Owners can add restaurants, customize menus, and grant employee access.
- Orders taken via EasyRestro are sent to the kitchen using EasyKDS.
- Data is stored and retrieved from Firebase Realtime Database.
